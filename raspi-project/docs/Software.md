# Precision Wire Cutter

[Previous sections remain unchanged]

## Software Architecture

Our Precision Wire Cutter employs a multi-process architecture to ensure efficient and responsive control of all components. This design allows for parallel operation and real-time responsiveness, crucial for precise wire cutting operations.

### Multi-Process Overview

The software is divided into several processes, each responsible for a specific component or functionality:

1. **Stepper Motor Control Processes**
   - Two separate processes for controlling each stepper motor
   - Enables independent operation of the wire feeding and cutting mechanisms
   - Utilizes precise timing for accurate step control

2. **LCD Display Process**
   - Handles all updates to the 16x2 LCD screen
   - Manages the user interface, displaying current status, measurements, and menu options
   - Operates independently to ensure smooth updates without affecting motor control

3. **Incremental Encoder Reading Process**
   - Continuously monitors the incremental encoder for user input
   - Detects rotation direction and speed for menu navigation and value adjustments
   - Processes button presses for selections and mode changes

4. **Main Control Process**
   - Coordinates communication between all other processes
   - Manages the overall state of the system
   - Processes user inputs and translates them into actions for other components

### Inter-Process Communication

The processes communicate with each other using a combination of:
- Shared memory for fast data exchange
- Message queues for command passing
- Signals for interrupt-based communication

This architecture allows for:
- Real-time responsiveness to user inputs
- Smooth and accurate control of motor movements
- Concurrent operation of all system components
- Easy expansion and modification of individual processes

### Software Stack

- **Operating System**: [e.g., Raspbian, custom Linux distribution]
- **Programming Language**: [e.g., Python, C++]
- **Libraries Used**:
  - [e.g., RPi.GPIO for GPIO control]
  - [e.g., RPLCD for LCD interface]
  - [Any other significant libraries]
