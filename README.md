# Precision Wire Cutter

## Introduction

Welcome to the Precision Wire Cutter project! This innovative device is designed to accurately cut wires to specified lengths, catering to the needs of electronics enthusiasts, hobbyists, and professionals alike. By leveraging the power of modern microcontrollers and precision components, our wire cutter offers unparalleled accuracy and ease of use.

### Key Features

- **Dual Stepper Motor System**: Ensures precise wire feeding and cutting operations.
- **16x2 LCD Display**: Provides clear, real-time information on cut length, quantity, and system status.
- **Incremental Encoder**: Allows for intuitive user input and menu navigation.
- **Customizable Cut Lengths**: Capable of cutting wires from [minimum length] to [maximum length] with [precision] accuracy.
- **Multiple Wire Gauge Support**: Accommodates wire sizes ranging from [minimum gauge] to [maximum gauge] AWG.

## System Overview

Our Precision Wire Cutter combines hardware and software components to create a reliable and efficient wire cutting solution. The system utilizes:

1. Two stepper motors:
   - One for feeding the wire
   - One for operating the cutting mechanism
2. A 16x2 LCD screen for user interface
3. An incremental encoder for user input
4. A microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Arduino) for system control
